Java Query System

A simple but flexible Java application that demonstrates object-oriented programming, generics, custom filtering, and sorting using interfaces and comparators.

---

Overview

This project implements a reusable query system for `Book` and `Ebook` objects. It supports:

- Searching for books by title, author, and year
- Filtering `Ebook` objects by file size (e.g. `<= 5MB`)
- Sorting results using `Comparator`s and method references
- Polymorphism and inheritance through shared interfaces

It highlights Java development concepts including:

- Classes and inheritance
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Generics with bounds (`T extends`)
- Method references and lambda expressions
- Code modularity and clean design
